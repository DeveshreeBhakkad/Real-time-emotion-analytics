# Face Expression Detection 🎭

> "The face is a window to the emotions within." 😊

A Python project that detects human facial expressions in real-time using your webcam.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ **Real-time face detection** using OpenCV  
- 🤖 **Emotion recognition** using TensorFlow/Keras models  
- 📹 Works with **live webcam feed**  
- 🏷️ Displays detected **emotion labels dynamically** on the video

▶️ Usage

1. **Run the main program:**
```bash
python main.py
```
2. **What happens next:**

- 🖥️ Your webcam will open automatically
- 🤖 The program will detect faces in real-time
- 🏷️ Predicted emotion labels will appear dynamically on the video
- ❌ Press q (if implemented) to close the webcam window-
